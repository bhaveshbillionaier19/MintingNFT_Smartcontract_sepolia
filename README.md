Minting NFTs by using smartcontact myNFT.sol
*0x8D8756F6cCA0b852077866eeAd91E815f80D2667

(ADRESS WHERE IT IS STORED ON SEPOLIA)*

### How It Works:
- **Deployment Task**: `deploy-contract` handles the deployment of the `GameItem` contract.
- **Minting Task**: `mint-nft` handles the minting process, allowing you to mint NFTs with a custom token URI.


## Changes i made in given code
- Counters.sol is removed from open @openzeppelin
  ,
  
  so i am using this  https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/ erc721 instead of what was provided in github


- I made nft.js from scratch deploying and minting nfts using Web3.js library.

- I reconfigured the lib files to work according to my js file.
